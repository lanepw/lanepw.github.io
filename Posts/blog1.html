    <p> This is just a bit from a really nice single-page website for a magazine/journal/zine thingy. The design of the page follows the design of the product, using a geometric layout and black and red coloring. It's a simple site that presents a small amount of information in a clean, attractive format. It contains only one link, to buy the product- so with only one thing to possibly click on, and a short scroll, it's like reading a flyer or newsletter instead of a webpage, a format which I think works well for selling a printed journal. Good example of what formatting can do- technically this glory of a first-ever page is also just one page, with one link, and pictures and words. </p>
